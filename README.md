Arcade Game Frogger Clone is a Single Page App

This project is from my Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program at Udacity. This project is based on the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).

The goal of the game is to reaches the water (i.e. top of the game board), the game is won. The challenge is to avoid the bugs that travel on the road. If a bug is touched, the character is reset back at the beginning.

## Get Started
Click on this [link]() to see the website or you can download or clone the project, and loading up the index.html file in your browser.

##  Motivation
Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity for me to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences application architecture and provides performance optimization.

## What I learned from this project
During the project, I learned complex applications that must be “broken down” into simpler entities that manage their own properties and functionality. I also learned JavaScript’s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.
